## Dataset
The dataset contains scheduled and actual departure and arrival times reported by certified U.S. air carriers that account for at least one percent of domestic scheduled passenger revenues. The data is collected by the Office of Airline Information, Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS).

Reporting carriers are required to (or voluntarily) report on-time data for flights they operate: on-time arrival and departure data for non-stop domestic flights by month and year, by carrier and by origin and destination airport. Includes scheduled and actual departure and arrival times, canceled and diverted flights, taxi-out and taxi-in times, causes of delay and cancellation, air time, and non-stop distance.

## Summary of Findings:
To my surprise, Southwest airlines flies the most flights within the US by a wide margin, almost double the amount of flights vs. their next largest competitor.
Also, the do this with a much smaller fleet of airplanes. 

## Key Insights
Soutwest flies the most flights primarily achieved by flying short distance routes. Additionally they have an impectible on-time record and serve under subscribed airports.
